We are hosting our product on the OSU server. 
1. The user needs to be on campus to run the webpage. Otherwise, the user will need to connect to the OSU domain with a VPN, such as Cisco AnyConnect. There are further directions here on the Oregon State University website. The link is: http://oregonstate.edu/helpdocs/network-and-phone/virtual-private-network-vpn/
